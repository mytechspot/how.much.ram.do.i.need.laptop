**_In a nutshell, here are some simple guidelines that apply to most PCs and Macs:_**

* **4GB:** Low-end Chromebooks and some tablets come with 4GB of RAM, but it’s only worth considering if you’re on an extreme budget.
* **8GB:** Typically installed in entry-level notebooks. This is fine for basic Windows gaming at lower settings, but rapidly runs out of steam.
* **16GB:** Excellent for Windows and MacOS systems and also good for gaming, especially if it is fast RAM.
* **32GB:** This is the sweet spot for professionals. Gamers can enjoy a small performance improvement in some demanding games, too.
* **64GB and more:** For enthusiasts and purpose-built workstations only. Engineers, professional A/V editors, and similar types need to start here and go higher if needed.


Remember, buying more RAM than you need doesn’t net you any performance benefit — it’s effectively wasted money. Buy what you actually need, and spend the remaining budget on more important components like the CPU or graphics card.
